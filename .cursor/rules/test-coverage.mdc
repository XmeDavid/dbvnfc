# Test Coverage Required

Every code change must include corresponding tests.

## Features

New features require tests that verify the feature works as expected:

- Backend: Add tests in `backend/src/test/java/...` mirroring the source structure
- Frontend: Add tests alongside components or in `__tests__` directories
- Cover happy path and key edge cases

## Bug Fixes

Bug fixes require a regression test that:

1. Would have failed before the fix
2. Passes after the fix
3. Prevents the bug from recurring

## Test Locations

| Component | Test Location |
|-----------|---------------|
| Backend services | `backend/src/test/java/com/prayer/pointfinder/service/` |
| Backend controllers | `backend/src/test/java/com/prayer/pointfinder/controller/` |
| Frontend components | Same directory as component, `*.test.tsx` |

## Workflow

1. Write/modify the code
2. Write tests covering the change
3. Run tests via Docker (`make test-docker`)
4. Verify tests pass before considering the task complete
