-Feedback is not used practically. So the reviewer of a submission can add feedback, but then the players dont see it
-Its a good idea to limit the dropdowns of available challanges to select. But there is this bug, where if i assign a challange to only one team, when trying to select for the other team, that challange is not available, even tho it has not been assigned to that team.
