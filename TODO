Code (in codebase)


- NFC scanning on Android review - not finished.

- Handle same-device multiple logins correctly (device ID should not change each time).

- Add reset password feature for operators.

- Android landing page auth choice: player join should be the primary action, operator should be secondary.
- Improve Android error handling (for example, login errors).
- Android colors seem off in some places.
- Use more icons on Android where relevant.
- Android landing page (player/operator login): no visible title in dark mode.
- Settings on Android is still not great, need to match parity with iOS.
- Do a general Android parity and UI polish pass.

- Android map zoom animation goes too far out and back in (likely map is being recreated).
- Android team pins look like bases; improve visual distinction.
- Android game list state tags are all the same color; differentiate by state.

- Android (and maybe iOS/web in some places) shows base coordinates in operator base list; this is not useful for users.
- Replace/hide coordinates and prioritize useful base description text.
- On small screens, web header is too large and breaks layout.
