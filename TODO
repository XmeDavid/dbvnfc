#Code (in codebase)

## Bugs
-The location bound on a challange, and the fixed based, should be synced
-Android sync issue: When submitting a photo on a base, the action becomes permanently as a pending action and never syncs, on iOS is working. On this android, the game was randomly also showing as ended, but that was no the case, I had to restart the app, and only then on a resync would the game lock of ended game disapear.



## Improvements
-Multiple correct answers for auto validation
-Confirm deletions with popup dialogs.


## Features
-Map view for guests, operators can generate a guest view token(lets say a 6 character code), we create a new page, that is guest facing, it should have great design, should have features similar to the live map view. the idea is to display on a television or something at the base. we use the code to not dox locations to everyone on the web.
-Recover password


## Test
-Test long videos


## Consider what we want to do
-What to do in terms of feeback, right now its only submitted by the operator, but the players never see it.
-Images on challanges(rich text) limit size. If resizing is implemented it's ok. we can ignore this one
