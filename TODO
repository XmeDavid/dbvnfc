#Code (in codebase)

## Bugs

## Improvements

## Features
-Map view for guests, operators can generate a guest view token(lets say a 6 character code), we create a new page, that is guest facing, it should have great design, should have features similar to the live map view. the idea is to display on a television or something at the base. we use the code to not dox locations to everyone on the web.
-Overwrite points on submissions. When an operator is on the review submission modal, it should start with the default points for the base, but allow the user to change it. This is for cases where submissions are slightly incomplete, but the operator considers it done, and wants to award a certain amount of points.


## Consider what we want to do
-What to do in terms of feeback, right now its only submitted by the operator, but the players never see it.
-Images on challanges(rich text) limit size. If resizing is implemented it's ok. we can ignore this one
