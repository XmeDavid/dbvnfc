- Delete breadcrumbs from web admin (They don't fit our usecase).
- Small screen fixes:
    - Globe icon + current lang - > just globe (tiny screens only)
    - Small screens Import game and create game, should go on top of eachother, instead of side to side.
    -Handle sideways overflow
- Text on android is often this weird purple, looks awful, specially on top of the green. Colors need clear improvement, let's not make anything to exotic.
- On web admin, an operator owner of a game should be able to kick other operators from that game.
