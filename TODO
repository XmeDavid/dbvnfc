Code (in codebase)
- Map view on bases, you cant click the pin to see info
- On challanges list, if a challange is on a fixed based already assigned, lets show in the card the name of the base. Maybe replace the location bound tag, to the base it was bounded to, if not bound keep the same, maybe a slight distinction on color, "location bound" maybe slightly faded, and if its the actual name of the base full black as is.
-The above, we can do the reverse, so if its fixed challange, and there is already a challange assign, we can show in the tag the challange.
-The "Manual / Randomizable Assignments",  when selecting a challange, it shows me on the dropdown challanges that already fixed, this should not be the case
-Everytime it makes sense, we should limit the dropdown, I see we do this already with the teams, which is great (if i assigned to one, it disappears from the dropdown when doing for the remaining teams)
-On iOS remove the image on the landing page for now
-On iOS, slight crop on the bottom line of the challange(last line of text is slightly croped at the bottom)
-Dont show the notes on the submission line, only when reviewing it.
-Feedback is not used for anything
-Notifications work manually sending to players from webadmin. But as an operator, it would be nice to receive notifications on mobile when teams submit something for aproval.
-Related to the above point, on mobile (iOS and Android), we should add another tab for the submissions. Sometimes an aproval is necessary to get the after content, and we dont want to keep players waiting, so the operator should be able to aprove easily on the go. So another tab, only exists when the game is live, with the submissions. Notifcations are already setup on both firebase and APNs so we can use that, but make this ones automatic based on the trigger of a submission.
-Operator notifications, should be configurable in settings, by default only submissions on manual aproving, but the operator could also choose to get notified by any submission, and even team checkins for exemple.
-On web admin, when a submission is pending aproval, instead of clicking the 3 dots, clicking anywhere on the card should open the review. We only want the 3 dots for already success or reject, since its less common to go overwrite those.

Outside Codebase (manual / ops / launch)

## Localization Review
- Check German translation with a German expert.
- Review all strings by testers

## Launch / Release
- Publish on App Store.
- Publish on Play Store.

## Infra / Domain / Email Routing
- Set up reverse proxy or forwarding so `info@desbravadores.dev` goes to personal email.
- Evaluate whether we need a different domain.

## Branding
- App icon.
