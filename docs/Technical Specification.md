## System Overview

### Purpose
DBV NFC Games is a physical adventure game platform designed for organized group events (primarily scouting activities). Teams physically visit real-world locations ("bases") to solve challenges ("enigmas") using NFC technology for validation and progress tracking.

### Core Concept
- **Physical Adventure Gaming**: Teams move between real locations to solve puzzles
- **NFC-Based Validation**: Physical presence is verified through NFC tag interactions
- **Competitive Progression**: Teams compete by completing bases quickly and accurately
- **Controlled Access**: Invite-only system prevents unauthorized participation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Operators track team progress and locations live

### Scale & Limitations
- **Target Size**: Up to 100 people per event
- **Concurrent Games**: One active game at a time initially
- **Languages**: Portuguese primary, English future consideration
- **Platforms**: Web admin panel + iOS mobile app

## Core Game Mechanics

### Game States
1. **Setup**: Game creation and configuration phase
2. **Live**: Active gameplay with teams participating
3. **Finished**: Game completed, results available

### Game Lifecycle

#### 1. **Setup Phase**
**Requirements to Go Live:**
- At least 1 base created
- At least 1 team created
- At least 1 enigma created
- All bases linked to NFC tags
- Enigmas assigned (automatic for non-location-dependent)

**Actions Available:**
- Create/edit bases with GPS coordinates
- Create/edit enigmas with content and answers
- Create teams with invite codes
- Link bases to physical NFC tags (mobile app)

#### 2. **Live Phase**
**Team Gameplay Flow:**
1. **Base Arrival**: Team leader taps NFC tag → "arrived" status
2. **Enigma Solving**: Team views enigma content and submits answer
3. **Answer Validation**: System validates answer (offline capable)
4. **Base Completion**: After correct answer, leader taps NFC again → "completed"
5. **Progress Tracking**: Timestamps recorded for all actions

**Fair Play Enforcement:**
- Only team leader can tap NFC tags
- Teams cannot start new bases until current one completed
- Location tracking validates team presence
- Answer validation prevents cheating

#### 3. **Finished Phase**
**Available Actions:**
- View final results and statistics
- Export game data and reports
- Analyze team performance and timing

### Base and Enigma System

#### Base Types
**All bases require physical NFC tags for interaction**

#### Enigma Types
1. **Location-Dependent Enigmas**
   - Permanently tied to specific bases
   - Content references physical objects/clues at location
   - Same enigma for all teams at that base
   - Example: "Count the red balls hidden here" (answer: actual count)

2. **Location-Independent Enigmas**
   - Can be assigned to any base
   - Randomly distributed at game start
   - Different teams may get different enigmas at same base
   - Prevents answer sharing between teams

#### Dynamic Assignment Logic ✅ IMPLEMENTED
When a game transitions to "Live" status, the system automatically executes sophisticated enigma assignment:

**Algorithm Features:**
- **Location-Dependent Preservation**: Enigmas tied to specific bases remain fixed
- **Intelligent Distribution**: Location-independent enigmas are distributed using rotation logic
- **Team Uniqueness**: Each team receives a different combination to prevent answer sharing
- **Cyclical Assignment**: More enigmas than bases are supported with wrap-around distribution
- **Database Storage**: All assignments stored in `team_enigma_assignments` table for persistence

**Example Distribution:**
- Game has 3 bases, 5 location-independent enigmas, 3 teams
- Team A gets: (Base1→Enigma1, Base2→Enigma2, Base3→Enigma3)  
- Team B gets: (Base1→Enigma2, Base2→Enigma3, Base3→Enigma4)
- Team C gets: (Base1→Enigma3, Base2→Enigma4, Base3→Enigma5)

**API Integration:**
- Teams retrieve assigned enigmas: `GET /api/team/bases/{baseId}/enigma`
- Validation ensures teams only solve their assigned enigmas
- Answer validation includes assignment verification
