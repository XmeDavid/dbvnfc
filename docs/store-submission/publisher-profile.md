## Notes

- You are the sole data controller as an individual (no company entity required).
- The privacy policy already names "PointFinder" as the service; store listings should reference the same name.
- Google Play requires the deletion URL to be publicly accessible without login. The privacy policy deletion section serves this purpose.
- `pointfinder.ch` serves the same platform with German defaults; use `.pt` links for store metadata and support contact consistency.
